Minecraft Files and Installer

This program assumes you have the most recent 
version of Java and Powershellv4 installed.

THIS PROGRAM MUST BE RAN AS ADMIN

If you are running this for the first time you will need to 
'Install Minecraft', 'Install Forge', 'Update Mods', and then 'Launch Game'

If while connecting to the server you had issues then just run
'Update Mod's' and then 'Launch Game'

If problems continue you can run 'Remove Current Mods' and this will 
backup and then clean out your mods directory.

You will then need to run 'Update Mods' and relaunch the game.
